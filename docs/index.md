## So what is Jekyll, exactly?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template
directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (or
[Textile](http://textile.sitemonks.com/)) and
[Liquid](http://wiki.shopify.com/Liquid)

for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine
behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which means you can use Jekyll
